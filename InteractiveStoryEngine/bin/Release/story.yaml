    Imagine yourself. You find yourself trapped in a small chamber
    beneath what seems to be a larger chamber in which you can
    hear the clammering of what must only be other humanlike creatures.

    In one corner of the chamber you see a reservoir with a printed note of a dollar sign: ($)

    A lever lies to the right of the reservoir and a note hangs from the lever.
  returningText:
    You panic! You scramble around the chamber looking for a door but you cannot find one.
    You reach the lever and pull it in a fit of rage while yelling towards the ceiling.

    You feel a pinch in your leg and your vision begins to become hazy.

    You awaken after what feels like forever in a state of confusion lying on the floor of the chamber.

      You approach the note and read the text engraived on its label:

      "Welcome to your new life as a slave drone."

      You read further below the intro text:

      "Please find some way to make yourself productive if you want to be promoted.
      And by be promoted, we mean if you want to live."

    You peer around the chamber cautiously. You are still in shock from waking
    up in a foreign place without any explanation. Memories of last night flood back.
    You had just come back from work after getting a big promotion.

    Where was it that you worked again...

    A voice emenates from some corner of the chamber, but you cannot pin down
    the exact location:

    "If you want to live, please find a way to be productive."

    "Perhaps one day you will learn..."
